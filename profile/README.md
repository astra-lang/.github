  <em>AI‑Native Orchestration Language — Patent Pending</em>
</p>

---

Astra is an AI‑native orchestration language designed to bridge flexible, natural‑language‑shaped
expression with deterministic execution. It introduces a multilayer architecture that separates
expression, semantic resolution, normalization, and execution — enabling both humans and AI
systems to write programs that remain predictable, auditable, and safe.

This organization will become the home of:

- the Astra language specification  
- the reference interpreter  
- the pattern registry  
- the drift‑aware safety layer  
- the introspection engine  
- documentation, examples, and tooling  

The first public release is in active development.

Stay tuned.
